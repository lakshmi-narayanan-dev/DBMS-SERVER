Domain name vs Hosting vs Cpanel vs FTP vs Database

- Domain Name is like a name to an IP Address / Website. 
- Hosting is a kind of harddisk/SSD storage to store my code online. [Hostinger , Blue Host , Zola Host]
- Cpanel is the technical Control panel for your web hosting account. 
- Database = MongoDB = JSON format = Non-relational DB = Scalable 

------------
Hostinger + Zolahost
------------
VPS hosting [virtual Private Server] = Dedicated Hosting or server - only you use the entire hardware available - Amazon
VPS - Amazon, Zolahost VPS - It is buying a dedicated Virtual Server to my website or web application
Shared hosting is slower compare to VPS hosting [virtual Private Server]
Shared Hosting is used my two or more customer to make money using small scale customers by Hosting companies.

-----------
Cpanel
----------
It uploads files and folders securely to the web hosting location.
Cpanel is a kind of Admin Access to the server - email , dependencies , name , connect domain name update. 
Example - Plesk , Hpanel , Cpanel

-----------
FTP
----------
FTP is File Transfer Protocol , Transferring of Files from one computer to another [here's to the server]
SFTP - Secure FTP
FTP client > where you use to upload Files to Server
Filezilla + Cyberduck

Port 20, 21

To return to our analogy: If your hosting account were a car or an airplane, 
FTP would be the equivalent of keys to doors and the FTP client would be the 
stairs that lead you to the doors.

Bank is my Hosting account - ATM/CDM is my Cpanel - ATM card is my FTP client
Sometimes i dont need an ATM to withdrawl money , i can go to the bank - fill a challan [Cpanel] - Get my money.
